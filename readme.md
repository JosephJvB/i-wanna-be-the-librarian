# I wanna be the librarian

- TS express backend
  - save uploaded files to file-system
  - serve uploaded file meta-information: filename/extension/size?
  - save files to dist/temp so client can read/download the files
  - clear dist/temp on success or failure
- use JS framework frontend. Prob vue
  - see all uploaded files
  - filter/search uploaded files
  - can download single-files to computer
  - can download all files as backup

Is vue in typescript hard? I can think of one way to find out my man.

Todo:
- scripts to reset meta.json and uploads folder on heroku
